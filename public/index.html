<h3 id="loanconnect---cto">LoanConnect - CTO</h3>
<p>I joined <a href="https://loanconnect.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoanConnect</a> in the very early days of the company. When I left we had reached the total addressable market in Canada for sub-prime borrowers. The key to our success was optimizing the borrower life-cycle events to match hyper-targeted marketing messages.</p>
<p>The technology evolved under my leadership in two important directions: the first was in synchronizing the marketing message and channels to the borrower. If they had abandoned their partially completed application a call center rep would call them to help finish the form. If they had been rejected by a lender, an automated email with alternative loan offers was sent. And many more in-the-moment automations kept the borrower on track and on a path to success.</p>
<p>The second innovation was all around deep integration with our partners. We helped Lenders expose APIs and Callback interfaces so that a borrower would never have to enter their data twice. And once rejected the Lender via the callback would earn commissions on future events for that borrower as they re-entered the LoanConnect system as an affiliate tracked lead. The affiliate tracking and commission sharing ultimately resulted in near 100% visibility into all the active borrowers seeking sub-prime loans in Canada.</p>

<li><strong>Web App and API:</strong> CakePHP, MySQL, RabbitMQ, jQuery</li>
<li><strong>Hosting:</strong> DigitalOcean</li>

<p>I managed a large team in this company. Together we built an amazing BlackBerry TV product that didn’t ship. Our team was instead re-tasked into the PlayBook and BB10 launch effort. A whole lot of very interesting work was done. And my name ended up on four patents.</p>
