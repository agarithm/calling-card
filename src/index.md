### J.D. Power - Technology Manager

#### AI Cloud: a Multi-tenant Data Warehouse and Low Code ETL Platform

The <a href="https://cloud.jdpower.ai/app/aic/index.html#/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Cloud</a> system powers much of the internal data processing within J.D. Power.  It is a highly scalable platform running batch processing jobs using Kubernetes on GKE and Fargate. Included in this work is a user friendly (low-code) Web Application that helps data analysts configure and operate complex data pipelines (ETL/Data Warehouse).

My role on the team is to maintain the AI Cloud system while expanding its capabilities.  I set the roadmap for the AI Cloud team and oversee all work done on the platform.

### Signal Flare - CTO / Founder

#### Signal Flare: Let your analytics tell your story

It was a simple observation that lead me to build <a href="https://signalflare.app/" target="_blank">Signal Flare</a>.  Tracking the SEO actions taken through to their effects on our marketing dashboards was exceedingly difficult.  A new campaign would be launched and a week or two later identifying the campaign on the charts in our analytics dashboard would be a real chore.  It gets worse as you move from tool to tool: Google Analytics, ahrefs, Semrush, etc.

Signal Flare centralizes your annotations so that everywhere you go, your charts are augmented with your notes.  Now it's easy to see where a campaign starts or ends in all of dashboards.

- **Chrome Extension:** React, Redux, antd, D3.js, Firestore

### LoanConnect - CTO

I joined <a href="https://loanconnect.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoanConnect</a> in the very early days of the company.  When I left we had reached the total addressable market in Canada for sub-prime borrowers.  The key to our success was optimizing the borrower life-cycle events to match hyper-targeted marketing messages.

The technology evolved under my leadership in two important directions: the first was in synchronizing the marketing message and channels to the borrower.  If they had abandoned their partially completed application a call centre rep would call them to help finish the form.  If they had been rejected by a lender, an automated email with alternative loan offers was sent.  And many more in-the-moment automations kept the borrower on track and on a path to success.

The second innovation was all around deep integration with our partners.  We helped Lenders expose APIs and Callback interfaces so that a borrower would never have to enter their data twice.  And once rejected the Lender via the callback would earn commissions on future events for that borrower as they re-entered the LoanConnect system as an affiliate tracked lead.  The affiliate tracking and commission sharing ultimately resulted in near 100% visibility into all the active borrowers seeking sub-prime loans in Canada.

- **Web App and API:** CakePHP, MySQL, RabbitMQ, jQuery
- **Hosting:** DigitalOcean
- **Call Centre:** Salesforce, Five9, Mailchimp, Sendgrid

### BlackBerry - Senior Software Engineering Manager

I managed a large team in this company.  Together we built an amazing BlackBerry TV product that didn't ship. Our team was instead disbanded and dropped into the PlayBook and BB10 launch effort.  A whole lot of very interesting work was done.  And my name ended up on four patents.
