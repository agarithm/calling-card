#### AI Cloud: a Multi-tenant Data Warehouse and Low Code ETL Platform

The <a href="https://cloud.jdpower.ai/app/aic/index.html#/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Cloud</a> system powers much of the internal data processing within J.D. Power.  It is a highly scalable platform running batch processing jobs using Kubernetes on GKE and Fargate. Included in this work is a user friendly (low-code) Web Application that helps data analysts configure and operate complex data pipelines (ETL/Data Warehouse).

My role on the team is to maintain the AI Cloud system while expanding its capabilities.  I set the roadmap for the AI Cloud team and oversee all work done on the platform.
